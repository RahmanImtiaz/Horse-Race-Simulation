# Horse-Race-Simulation

This is a Horse Race Simulation project that uses Java GUI to simulate a horse race. The simulation includes a betting system and customization of horses and tracks. This project was created as a part of Year 1 OOP Project.

The project is divided into two parts: `Part1` and `Part2`. `Part1` contains the initial implementation of the horse race simulation without a GUI. `Part2` extends `Part1` by adding a GUI and additional features like a betting system and customization of horses and tracks.

## Getting Started

### Setup Steps

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
3. Navigate to the part 1 or part 2 directory depending on which part of the project you want to run. Part 1 to run the textual implementation, and Part 2 to run the GUI implementation.

### Dependencies

This project is built with Java and uses the Swing library for the graphical user interface in `Part2`. No other dependencies are required. Make sure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest JDK from Oracle's [Official Website](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/#java21).

### Usage Guidelines (Command Line)

1. To run the program, navigate to the directory containing `main.java` in either `Part1` or `Part2` using the command `cd Part1` or `cd Part2`.
2. Compile the Java files using the command `javac *.java`.
3. Run the program using the command `java main`.

### Using an IDE Instead

If you prefer to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) instead of the command line, you can do so. Here are the general steps:

1. Open your preferred IDE (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
2. Import/Open the project into your IDE. This usually involves selecting 'Open' or 'Import' from the 'File' menu and then navigating to the project directory.
3. Once the project is imported/Opened, you should be able to navigate through the project files using the IDE's project explorer.
4. To run the program, locate the `main.java` file in either `Part1` or `Part2`, right-click on it and select 'Run' or 'Debug'. The exact steps may vary depending on your IDE.

Please refer to your IDE's documentation for more specific instructions.

## GUI Simulation Instrctions (How to Play)
### Part 2 (GUI):
#### How to customise Track
- When running the GUI implementation from Part1, press the start button.
- Enter the track length, this can be between 10 and 100 meters.
- Enter how many lanes you would like, this can be between 2 and 10 lanes.
- And then you can cho0se what colour you want for the track.

### How to add Horses
- In the beginning, you will be asked to make at least 2 horses, before being allowed onto the race screen. The initial screen for adding horses, will have two buttons "Submit & Start Race" and "Submit & add Another Horse".
- The "Submit & Start Race" button, saves and creates the current horse, and then opens the race frame to start the race. This option is only available after 2 horses are made.
- "Submit & add Another Horse" button, saves and creates the current horse, and then allows for another horse to be created and added.
- When on the racing screen, you can add horses to the unoccupied lanes using the "Add Horse" button on top. This button is only accessable when there are unoccupied lanes, before and after a race. They cannot be accessed during a race or if there arent any more free lanes.
- You can then cho0se the colour, name, confidence (0-1), breed and accessory for that horse.

### How to view Horse Stats
- When on the horse window, you can press the "Show Stats" on the top of the window. Then on a small pop up window, you can choose the horse you want to view.

### Changing the horse name
- There is a list of horses on the right side panel of the raceing frame (under betting panel).
- You can press on a horses name, and a pop up window will appear, presenting that horses name and confidence.
- The name can be modified and saved, but the confidence can not be changed (only viewed).

### Placing a bet
- Each round, you can place a bet on any horse on the tracks.
- You will be allocated an initial balance of Â£1000.
- Using the drop down menu, you can select the horse you want to bet on.
- Then you can enter an amount you want to bet on that horse, minimum 0, and maximum bet is ur balance amount.
- The betting feature is accessed before a race, and can be used to bet on a horse. 

### Start Race and New Race
- Both buttons are on the top of the race window. 
- Pressing Start Race, will let the current race begin.
- Pressing New Race, opens up a new race, with the same horses and details.
- Start Race button is only available once before a race (to start it).
- New Race button is only available after the current race has ended.

## Files in the Project

- `Horse.java`: This file contains the Horse class which is used to create horse objects for the simulation.
- `HorseIcon.java`: This file is used to handle the horse icons in the GUI (only in `Part2`).
- `Race.java`: This file contains the Race class which is used to simulate the horse race.
- `RaceFrame.java`: This file is used to create the GUI frame for the race (only in `Part2`).
- `User.java`: This file contains the User class which is used to handle user interactions in the betting system (only in `Part2`).
- `main.java`: This is the main class that runs the program.
